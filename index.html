          <p class='description'>
            The Pulwama attack, a devastating terrorist act that occurred on February 14, 2019, in the Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, India, targeted a convoy of vehicles carrying Indian security personnel. A suicide bomber affiliated with the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into one of the convoy buses, resulting in the tragic deaths of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and injuring many others. This heinous act not only sparked widespread condemnation and international outrage but also escalated tensions between India and Pakistan, leading to a significant military confrontation. The attack underscored the persistent threat of terrorism in the region and heightened concerns over cross-border terrorism originating from Pakistan.
